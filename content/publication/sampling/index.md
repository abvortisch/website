abstract: "On 5 September 2015, the German government suspended the EU's Dublin III regulations, allowing all asylum seekers to apply for asylum in Germany. This policy change motivated more than one million people, especially Syrians, Afghans, and Iraqis, to enter the country. This study examines the impact of this policy change on migration aspirations and actions in 11 Arab countries, assessing whether it increased migration pressure toward Germany. We find that while the policy raised migration aspirations, it did not significantly affect concrete migration plans and therefore immigration pressures. Instead, age and personal networks abroad play more decisive roles in shaping such plans. Additionally, territorial control by IS in certain regions served as a distinct push factor. We also analyze migration preparations and find that age and networks abroad remain key determinants. Our results also suggest that the policy may have altered the composition of those planning to migrate."

# abstract: "Certain case studies require the estimation of discrete choice models with a very large number of alternatives and attributes, which in turn increases the computational cost. This challenge becomes even more pronounced in the family of Multivariate Extreme Value (MEV) models such as the cross-nested logit (CNL) model due to the additional complexity in the model specification. In this study,  we investigate the use of sampling of alternatives to make the estimation of MEV models more tractable. Using migration aspiration data, we assess how different sampling protocols and sample sizes approximate the parameters of the full choice set model. Our results show that importance sampling strategies informed by observed choice frequencies outperform random sampling, providing more stable estimates even with small subsets of alternatives. These findings highlight that carefully designed sampling can substantially reduce estimation time without compromising accuracy, thereby making MEV models a practical tool for studying migration destination choice."
