abstract: Immigration restrictions to the US are a rather modern policy. One of
  the most significant policy changes, the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924, drastically
  limited the number of new immigrants per year, especially from Asia. In
  combination with the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, immigration per country was
  capped at 2 percent of the respective population in the 1890 census. In this
  study, I examine to what extent immigration restrictions affected labor market
  outcomes of prior migration cohorts. Using decennial census data, I apply a
  difference-in-difference estimation, exploiting the fact that restrictions
  initially did not impact the Philippines, then a US colony. Preliminary
  results indicate that initial immigration restrictions affected exempted
  Filipinos, highlighting the impact of competition on their economic
  assimilation. Relative to other migrants, labor force participation and
  employment rates of Filipinos increased, while their log income scores
  declined. Preliminary individual panel data analysis does not support the
  current findings in the cross-sectional evaluation.
