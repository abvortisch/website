abstract: Immigration restrictions to the US are rather modern policies. One of
  the most significant policy changes, the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924, drastically
  limited the number of new immigrants per year, especially from Asia. In
  combination with the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, immigration per country was
  capped at 2 percent of the respective population in the 1890 census. In this
  paper, I examine to what extent immigration restrictions affected labor market
  outcomes of prior migration cohorts. Using decennial census data, I apply a
  difference-in-difference estimation, considering that restrictions initially
  did not impact the Philippines, then a US territory. My findings indicate that
  initial immigration restrictions affected exempted Filipinos, highlighting the
  impact of competition on their economic assimilation. Relative to other
  migrants, labor force participation and employment rates of Filipinos
  increased while their log income scores declined. This finding corroborates
  previous studies that emphasize the relevance of substitutability among
  immigrant cohorts. Individual panel data analysis partially supports the
  findings in the cross-sectional evaluation.
