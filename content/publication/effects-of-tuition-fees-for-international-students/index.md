abstract: Education has become a highly international export good with
  increasing numbers of students learning abroad. Yet, little is known about the
  way international students migrate and how policies influence their decision.
  This article evaluates the policy in one German state to charge tuition from
  international students since 2017, while education remains free in all other
  states. For my analysis, I collect and combine publicly available records for
  institutions of higher education in Germany since 1998. Using
  difference-in-differences, I find a significant decrease of about 2 percentage
  points in international enrollment in the treated state after the policy
  change. Africa and Asia are the most affected continents of origin. In
  contrast to state government motivations, I find no evidence for a short-term
  decrease in exam failure rates.
